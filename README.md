# Tokenized Manufacturing Process Optimization (TMPO)

## Overview

TMPO is a blockchain-based platform that digitizes and optimizes manufacturing processes through tokenization. By creating a secure, transparent record of all production activities, TMPO enables real-time optimization, quality assurance, and process improvement.

## Key Components

### Facility Verification Contract
Validates and registers legitimate production facilities on the blockchain.
- Maintains registry of verified manufacturing sites
- Stores facility certifications and compliance records
- Manages facility-level permissions and access control

### Equipment Registration Contract
Records comprehensive details of manufacturing assets within each facility.
- Tracks equipment specifications and capabilities
- Maintains service history and performance metrics
- Links equipment to authorized operators and maintenance personnel

### Process Parameter Contract
Manages and monitors production settings and environmental conditions.
- Records machine settings for each production run
- Tracks environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Stores process recipes and production specifications
- Enables parameter version control and comparison

### Quality Outcome Contract
Documents product specifications and testing results.
- Records quality inspection data
- Tracks pass/fail rates and specification compliance
- Stores test methodologies and acceptance criteria
- Links outcomes to specific process parameters

### Optimization Contract
Facilitates continuous improvement initiatives across the manufacturing ecosystem.
- Identifies correlation between process parameters and quality outcomes
- Suggests optimal settings based on historical data
- Tracks improvement initiatives and their results
- Manages optimization tokens and incentives

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Web3 provider credentials

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/tmpo.git
cd tmpo
npm install
```

### Quick Start
1. Configure your blockchain connection in `config.js`
2. Deploy smart contracts: `npm run deploy`
3. Register your first facility: `npm run register-facility`

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// Initialize TMPO client
const tmpo = new TMPO.Client(config);

// Register new equipment
await tmpo.registerEquipment({
  facilityId: "0x123...",
  name: "Injection Molding Machine #5",
  serialNumber: "IM-2025-789",
  manufacturer: "Precision Systems"
});

// Record process parameters
await tmpo.recordParameters({
  equipmentId: "0x456...",
  batchId: "B-20250506-001",
  parameters: {
    temperature: 195.5,
    pressure: 850,
    cycleTime: 45.2
  }
});

// Record quality outcomes
await tmpo.recordQuality({
  batchId: "B-20250506-001",
  metrics: {
    dimensionAccuracy: 99.7,
    surfaceQuality: 4.8,
    strengthTest: "PASS"
  }
});
```
